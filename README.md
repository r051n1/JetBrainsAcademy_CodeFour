# JetBrainsAcademy_ConnectFour

This project is a simple implementation of the game Connect Four. 

The package has four classes in it, the application runner which contains the main method to create a new window, the Connect Four class that contains the settings
for the window, the Cell class that contains fields and behaviours for every cell, and the reset button to initialize a new game.

I decided to publish this project because I saw not many people choose this project on JetBrains Academy and I could not find any publication of this project before me,
so I thought this might be useful for someone.
